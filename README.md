## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Waterfall Methodology:
Advantages:
It’s straightforward and easy to manage with clear phases.
Works well for projects with fixed requirements.
Disadvantages:
It’s rigid and doesn’t handle changes well.
Problems may only be discovered late in the process, leading to costly fixes.
Not ideal for projects where requirements evolve.
Agile Methodology:
Advantages:
Flexible and adapts easily to changes.
Encourages ongoing feedback and improvement.
Great for projects with changing requirements or high user involvement.
Disadvantages:
Can be unpredictable and harder to manage.
Requires constant communication and collaboration.
Scope creep can be a problem if not controlled.

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Agile:
Projects where requirements are expected to change frequently or where customer feedback is crucial.
Example: Developing a new social media app where user preferences and feedback drive ongoing changes.
Waterfall:
Projects with clearly defined requirements and low chances of change.
Example: Building a regulatory compliance system where the requirements are fixed and well understood.

## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
Ensuring quality is vital to delivering a reliable and effective product. High-quality standards lead to satisfied users, fewer defects, and lower maintenance costs.
Methods to ensure quality include:
Testing: Conduct various types of testing, like unit and system testing, to catch issues early.
Code Reviews: Regularly review code to ensure it meets quality standards.
Automated Testing: Use tools to automate repetitive testing tasks.
Follow Best Practices: Adhere to coding standards and guidelines.
Quality Audits: Periodically check the project’s quality to identify and address issues
## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
Defining the project scope helps set clear boundaries and expectations, which prevents scope creep and ensures everyone is on the same page.
Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):IT is a visual breakdown of all the work needed for the project, divided into smaller, manageable parts.it Helps organize tasks, allocate resources, and track progress effectively.
